# Docker usage

This folder use to maintain the docker image which I use to implement minimal p4env.

## Usage

* `./build.sh`
    * build the environment (via Dockerfile)
* `./run.sh`
    * if you have run build.sh before, then you just need to use run.sh only.
* `./clear.sh`
    * if you want to clear this container, use clear.sh.
